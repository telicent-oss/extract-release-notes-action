# Extract Release Notes Action

This repository provides a GitHub Action that tries to automatically extract release notes based on a provided Change
Log file, e.g. `CHANGELOG.md`, or automatically using GitHub's automatic release notes functionality.

It produces two outputs, a `string` with a path to a file containing the extracted release notes (if any), and a
`boolean` indicating whether automatic release note generation has been configured.

# Requirements

- This action requires a runner with a Bash shell available

# Usage
